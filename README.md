# U-net-for-Image-segmentation

Project Title : Semantic Segmentation for Self Driving, using the data captured via CARLA  self-driving car simulator.

Project Objectives:

1.Create a Model to predict semantic segmentations of CARLA images
 
2.Predict masks using the model and compare with ground-truth masks

Dataset Overview: The dataset has images and labeled semantic segmentations captured via CARLA self-driving car simulator. 
The data which was generated as part of the 2018 Lyft Udacity Perception Challenge consists of about 5000 images and their semantic segmentations.

Model Evaluation: Training accuracy - nearly 99% training accuracy after 30 epochs.

                  Testing accuracy  - nearly 94% accuracy on testing dataset has been achieved.
                  
Detailed explanation including the network architecture and results and prediction has been clearly described in the notebook attached above.
